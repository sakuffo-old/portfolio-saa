    <h4>Collatz Sequence</h4>
    <p>
      This ruby program will prompt the user for the end of a number range (1 to n)
      and calculate which number within that range has the longest collatz sequence.
    </p>
    <p>
      This solution utilizes basic caching to speed up the computation time. 

      As an example, finding the longest chain between 1 and 10000000 (10M) took 29~ seconds with caching and 92~ seconds without. 
    </p>
  </div>
  <div class="code-snip-box">
<pre><code class="language-ruby">
def collatz(ending_num)
  longest_chain = 1
  longest_starting = 1
  cache = {1 =&gt; 1}

  1.upto(ending_num) do |starting_num|
    chain = collatz_calc(starting_num)
    chain[:length] += cache[chain[:break_num]]

    if chain[:length] &gt; longest_chain
      longest_chain = chain[:length]
      longest_starting = starting_num
    end

    cache[starting_num] = chain[:length]
    starting_num += 1
  end

  longest_collatz_seq = {
    longest_num: longest_starting,
    chain_length: longest_chain
  }
  return longest_collatz_seq

end

  number = starting_num
  collatz_length = 0
  while (number != 1) &amp;&amp; (number &gt;= starting_num)
    number = (number % 2 == 0) ?  number/2 : (3 * number) + 1
    collatz_length += 1
  end

    length: collatz_length,

    <h4>Ordinal Challenge</h4>
    <p>
      This ruby program will convert a plain number
      to the ordinal of the number. So for example,
      if the user enters 2, it will display 2nd, if
      the user enters 3, it will display 3rd, etc.

    <h4>Foobar</h4>
    <p>
      This ruby program is an adaptation of a classic technical 
      interview problem which displays sequences 
      of the Foobar pattern.
